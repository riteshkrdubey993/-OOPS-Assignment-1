    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Encapsulation:\n",
    "Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit known as a class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components and can prevent unintended interference.Encapsulation helps in data hiding and reduces the complexity of the code by keeping related functionality and data together.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstraction:\n",
    "Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors they share. It involves defining a clear interface for a class while hiding the implementation details.Abstraction allows developers to focus on what an object does rather than how it achieves its functionality. It promotes the creation of well-defined, modular, and reusable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inheritance:\n",
    "Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit the properties and behaviors of an existing class (base class or superclass). It supports the creation of a hierarchy of classes.Inheritance promotes code reuse, extensibility, and the creation of a logical hierarchy among classes. Subclasses inherit attributes and methods from their parent classes and can override or extend them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Polymorphism:\n",
    "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables a single interface to represent different types of objects, and it can take various forms, such as method overloading and method overriding.Polymorphism simplifies code by allowing the use of a common interface to interact with different types of objects. It enhances flexibility and enables the creation of more generic and reusable code."

    "In Python, the __init__ function (commonly pronounced as \"dunder init\" or \"double underscore init\") is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created. The primary purpose of the __init__ method is to initialize the attributes of the object, providing them with default values or values provided by the user during the object's instantiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why the __init__ function is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialization of Attributes:The __init__ method is used to initialize the attributes of an object with specific values. These attributes represent the state of the object, and initializing them in the __init__ method ensures that the object starts with a well-defined state.\n",
    "2. Parameterized Construction: The __init__ method allows the class to accept parameters during object creation. These parameters can be used to customize the initial state of the object. This makes the class more versatile and adaptable to different use cases.\n",
    "3. Encapsulation: By initializing attributes within the __init__ method, you encapsulate the initialization logic within the class itself. This encapsulation helps in organizing code, making it more modular and maintainable.\n",
    "4. Implicit Invocation: The __init__ method is implicitly invoked when an object is created. This ensures that the initialization logic is automatically executed whenever a new instance of the class is instantiated."
